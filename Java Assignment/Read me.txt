Classes - User Input
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
User_Inputs
This class is just initilizing the variables for each part of the user input

Panels
Creating the main panel that everything gets put on

titles
Set the title values for each section of the panel

Temperature
Sets the temperature variables and the radio button positions of it

Ache
Sets the Ache variables and the radio button positions of it

Cough
Sets the cough variables and the radio button positions of it

Sore
Sets the sore variables and the radio button positions of it

Travel
Sets the travel variables and the radio button positions of it

button
Puts the position of the button to that panel and sets in in the middle


Classes - Excel_Sheet
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Excel_Sheets
This class opens up the Excel sheet and reads in the variables setting 
them all to lower case values for the program to read it in easier,It 
also returns the variables to the excel array.

Classes - 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Excel_Array
This class sets all the array values and creates the hashmap values

setHashmap
This class sets the variables of the hashmap to to a String, Double for each e.g. Temppos and tempNeg

HashmapValues
This array tells the user the size of the array for Excel_Sheet.
It also tells the user wheither the the values they put in match the values of the excel sheet/ It also compares to see if it is correct or not

Results
Tells the user if the they are Positive or Negative values for the output on CoronaTest

Classes - CoronaTest
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

CoronaTest
This class opens the second has gui for the user to tell them the results of their input values of the Covid_19 test
it also has a button to go back on the program this allows the users to take as many tests are they need for the amount of people in the program

Classes - Gui
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Gui
This class just sets the variables for the main gui, it opens the JFrame and sets all the dimentions of the program, It also centers the application to the middle of the screen

Classes - Control
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Control
The only use for this program is to launch the application for the User



Application Workings;
The application works by  the user pressing on the JRadio buttons on which simtimutes he/she has this gets put in to an array that compares it to the values of the Excel Sheet
and this allows it to see if the user has a match for any of the data sets that are in the Excel Sheet and tell them if they are positive or negative for Covid 19

If i had more time in the application i would add a feature to add more values in to the program by allowing users to add more values in to the Excel_Sheet from the Gui program
I would also try to make the application more fluid.
